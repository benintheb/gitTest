# Git From Hell

A course from [this site](https://opentutorials.org/course/2708)

## Git

Git is a specific program in the version control system classification.

Git is extremly complex and takes time to get used to and learn, but there are surely reasons why it is widely used. When there is a vastly complex code that is like hell to manage or share, integrated with git, the complexity of the project itself is dialed down a lot. For that is what version control systems are made for, to manage, backup, recover, and collaborate your files and projects.

### Version Control System

A version control system simply put is managing versions not by changing the file name. The changes in the files are managed by the computer. It is also useful for backups, recoveries, and collaborations.

Version control system is not a product name, but rather a set of specific products such as CVS, SVN, and GIT. Git is the most widely used version control system in this era.

There are fundamental elements that these different version control systems possess, and these values are going to be dealt with. There are also innovative elements that each of the system has, that lead the users from one system to the next one.

Services such as Dropbox and Google Drive also have elements of the version control system, in a way that it allows users to upload their files and keep track of it, and share them with other users.
